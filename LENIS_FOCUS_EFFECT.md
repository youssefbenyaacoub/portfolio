# 🎬 Lenis Reveal Effect - Advanced Implementation

## 🎯 What's New

Your portfolio now features **true Lenis-style reveal effects** with sophisticated focus management and dynamic color changing:

### **1. ✨ One-by-One Element Reveals**
- Elements appear **sequentially** as you scroll (150ms stagger between each)
- Each element gets its own reveal animation on-demand
- **Prevents visual clutter** - only one section active at a time
- **Console logs progress**: `✨ Revealed #1: DIV at 5.2%`

### **2. 🎯 Focus Spotlight Effect**
- **Only ONE element is "focused" at a time** (closest to viewport center)
- Focused element gets:
  - ✨ Bright glow effect: `drop-shadow(0 0 30px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.6))`
  - 📍 Higher brightness: `brightness(1.1)`
  - 🔝 Higher z-index (appears on top)
- **Non-focused elements dim slightly** (opacity: 0.7)
- Creates impression of "reading one thing at a time"

### **3. 🎨 Dynamic Color Changing**
- **Colors change based on section you're in**:
  - **Home** (#home): Blue → Cyan gradient
  - **About** (#about): Purple → Violet gradient  
  - **Skills** (#skills): Cyan → Blue gradient
  - **Projects** (#projects): Orange → Red gradient
  - **Contact** (#contact): Green → Cyan gradient
- Cards, borders, and glows use `--section-primary` CSS variable
- Smooth transition as you scroll between sections

### **4. 📍 Direction-Based Animations**
- **`.scroll-item` elements** → Slide in from **RIGHT** (`slideRightReveal`)
  - About content, contact info, etc.
  - Movement: `-60px` → `0px` on X-axis
- **`.scroll-card` elements** → Slide down from **TOP** (`slideDownReveal`)
  - Skills cards, project cards
  - Movement: `+60px` → `0px` on Y-axis + scale effect

## 🔍 How It Works

### **Reveal Sequence:**

```
1. User scrolls → Element enters viewport (75% threshold)
   ↓
2. JavaScript detects element
   ↓
3. 150ms delay added (for stagger effect)
   ↓
4. Element gets .visible + .reveal classes
   ↓
5. CSS animates: opacity 0→1, transform applied
   ↓
6. Console logs: "✨ Revealed #2: DIV at 8.3%"
   ↓
7. Element maintains focused state until next element enters
```

### **Focus Management:**

```
At every scroll frame:
- Find ALL elements with [data-aos], .scroll-item, .scroll-card
- Calculate distance from each to viewport CENTER
- Element with SMALLEST distance = FOCUSED
- Apply .focused class with spotlight effect
- Previous focused element loses spotlight
```

### **Color System:**

```
As you scroll:
1. Detect which SECTION is currently visible (50% threshold)
2. Get section ID: #about, #projects, etc.
3. Look up color palette from sectionColors object
4. Update CSS variables: --section-primary & --section-secondary
5. All cards/borders immediately use new colors
6. Next section's colors fade in smoothly
```

## 📊 Animation Details

### **Element Reveal Timing:**

| Element Type | Animation | Duration | Easing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[data-aos]` | Fade-up | 0.8s | `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` |
| `.scroll-item` (focused) | Slide-right + glow | 0.8s | Premium Lenis |
| `.scroll-card` (focused) | Slide-down + glow | 0.8s | Premium Lenis |
| Stagger between elements | Delay | **150ms** | N/A |

### **Focus Spotlight:**

```css
[data-aos].focused,
.scroll-item.focused,
.scroll-card.focused {
    z-index: 10;
    filter: brightness(1.1) drop-shadow(0 0 30px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.6));
    animation: focusSpotlight 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) forwards;
}
```

### **Color Transitions:**

```javascript
sectionColors = {
    'home': { primary: '#3b82f6', secondary: '#06b6d4' },    // Blue to Cyan
    'about': { primary: '#8b5cf6', secondary: '#7c3aed' },   // Purple to Violet
    'skills': { primary: '#06b6d4', secondary: '#3b82f6' },  // Cyan to Blue
    'projects': { primary: '#f59e0b', secondary: '#ef4444' }, // Orange to Red
    'contact': { primary: '#10b981', secondary: '#06b6d4' }   // Green to Cyan
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Adjust Stagger Timing:**
In `frontend-script.js`, change:
```javascript
const delayMs = revealIndex * 150; // Change 150 to your preferred delay (ms)
```

### **Adjust Focus Glow:**
In `frontend-styles.css`, modify:
```css
filter: brightness(1.1) drop-shadow(0 0 30px rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.6));
/*                      ↑ glow distance      ↑ glow color & opacity */
```

### **Add New Section Colors:**
In `frontend-script.js`:
```javascript
sectionColors = {
    'your-section': { primary: '#YOUR-COLOR', secondary: '#YOUR-COLOR' },
    // ...
}
```
